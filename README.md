# Monitoring Of Road Irregularities using Data Analytics

## Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing time-series data collected from the roads of Pune. The dataset consists of three-dimensional motion sensor readings captured at regular intervals. Using Python and libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, I processed the raw data, performed filtering techniques to remove noise, and visualized the filtered data using line plots. Additionally, I calculated statistical measures such as mean, median, and variance to understand the central tendency and variability of the dataset. The code is implemented in a Google Colab notebook for easy replication and sharing.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and filtering noisy sensor data.
- **Visualization:** Plotting time-series data to visualize motion patterns over time.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculating mean, median, and variance to understand data characteristics.
- **Google Colab Integration:** Code implementation in a collaborative Jupyter notebook environment.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Future Work

In future iterations of this project, I plan to explore advanced signal processing techniques for noise reduction and investigate additional statistical measures to gain deeper insights into the dataset. Furthermore, I aim to enhance the visualization by incorporating interactive features for better data exploration.
