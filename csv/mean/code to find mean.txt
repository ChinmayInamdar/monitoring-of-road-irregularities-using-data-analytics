code to find mean

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load filtered data for each trial from CSV files
trial1_data = pd.read_csv('filtered_stationary1_with noise.csv')
trial2_data = pd.read_csv('filtered_stationary2_with noise.csv')
trial3_data = pd.read_csv('filtered_stationary3_with noise.csv')

# Calculate the mean for each timestamp across the three trials
mean_data = (trial1_data + trial2_data + trial3_data) / 3

# Save the mean data to a new CSV file
mean_data.to_csv('mean_filtered_data_stationary_road.csv', index=False)
